# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
## Tasks
**0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py "here")
- The variable `number` will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You donâ€™t have to understand what `import`, `random. randint` do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be:
	- The number, followed by
		- if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
		- if the number is 0: `is zero`
		- if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
	- followed by a new line
